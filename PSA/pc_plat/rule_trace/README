README
-------

 1. This directory contains rules and traces for the evaluation of all NSLab's 
    packet classification algorithms.

 2. It originates from WUSTL's work: http://www.arl.wustl.edu/~hs1/
    Many thanks to their previous work!

 3. Minor modifications are introduced to simplify coding:
    The default rule (the whole search space) is attached to several classifiers
    Some traces are modified to coordinate with the rule's changes

 4. To obtain the vanilla rules and traces, please refer to the upper URL.
